## BeoLiving Intelligence

#### uses the core of BeoLink Gateway but is designed for a wider audience <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="2" -->

#### 4 times faster than BLGW <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="2" -->

Note:
- Meaning that if you are familiar with BeoLink Gateway you will be too with BeoLiving Intelligence

----
## BeoLiving Intelligence

#### 2 modes:

- ESSENTIAL
- PRO


Note:
+ ESSENTIAL mode comes from factory

----
### ESSENTIAL (1/2)

- Designed for end-user (*Plug & Play*)
- Easily add B&O devices, Philips Hue lighting and ONVIF cameras
- Fully configurable through the *BeoLiving App* (create Scenes, Zones, etc.)
- Passwordless: Improves security

Note:
+ Designed for the end-user, meaning that you don't need any technical knowledge
+ The idea is that when a customer buys a BLI, he will be able to install and start using it without any installer help
+ Most of its configuration is done through BeoLiving App
+ Web interface is only used for a few things. Network settings, Project info, User management, Firmware update and Service report are available. 
Configuration upload/download is not supported

----
### ESSENTIAL (2/2)
 
- Set content provider credentials
- Products groups
- Voice control (Alexa & IFTTT)
- Automatic firmware upgrade
- Remote support specialist

Note:
- Voice control: Alexa, Google Home (on the way) and Apple HomePod (looking forward to)
- most HA(Home Automation) systems are blocked
- Some HA systems will be added in the near future
- Recapitulation of ESSENTIAL

----
## PRO

- One-time payment for PRO upgrade
- The *ESSENTIAL*'s features
- The *BeoLink Gateway*'s features
- Remote access

Note:
- This upgrade is done through BLI web interface. 
- BLI PRO mode will unlock the rest of its capabilities. 
- Its web interface and configuration is practically the same as BeoLink Gateway

----
## Changes from BLGW

- MasterLink devices only integrated through BLC
- Beo4 and BeoRemote One commands deprecated from Macros
- No more manual sources: device's sources synchronized automatically
- No default admin password

Note:
+ By default, admin password is unknown. To set it to a known password, button function 2 must be entered. This will set admin password to "admin"for the next 5 minutes. Then, you must enter its web interface and at first you will be asked to set a new admin password.
+ This decision is based in security matters.

## Linking Alexa (2/3)

#### BeoLiving App goes to foreground

<iframe class="embed-responsive-item" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/W_4cyvD2Q1Q?autoplay=0&loop=1&playlist=W_4cyvD2Q1Q"  frameborder="0" width="800" height="450" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen></iframe>

|||
## Linking Alexa (3/3)

### Scan QR code with BeoLiving App

<iframe class="embed-responsive-item" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/IJ44nvO0l6Y?autoplay=0&loop=1&playlist=IJ44nvO0l6Y"  frameborder="0" width="800" height="450" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen></iframe>

Note:
If you start the linking procedure using your laptop or any other device that hasn't installed BLApp you can scan a QR code with it

|||
### Alexa Tips

+ Alexa's device name = "_Zone name_" +  "_Device name_"
+ Devices names should be chosen properly
+ Create scenes for most frequent use cases or as a workaround if Alexa doesn't understand an instruction.

Note:
+ Source selection sometimes becomes un-useful if device names or source name are complicated

# IFTTT

+ Real world events trigger Macros
+ Control IFTTT supported systems

### Service troubleshooting & Recovery mode guide

- ECON usb to get service report
- Service magic USB to recovery a "DEAD" box

Note:
+ "DEAD" box is a theoretical situation
+ Useful when web interfaces is broken or dead and its not possible to create a service report.
+ Recovery: insert pendrive with specific .zip file and BLI will boot from that pendrive. Will erase all configuration and download the last firmware.
