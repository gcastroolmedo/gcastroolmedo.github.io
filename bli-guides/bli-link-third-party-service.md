## Introduction

_BeoLiving Intelligence_ has the ability to integrate with different Cloud Services, e.g.: Alexa. Integration level with 
_BeoLiving Intelligence_ depends on each service.
> Some examples of different capabilities: voice control of specific light or group of lights,
thermostats, _Bang & Olufsen_ A/V devices or receive an email when _BeoLiving Intelligence_ fires a specific command or triggers a specific event. 

Description of your installation's control capabilities through each third party cloud service can be found in their respective websites. 

This ability is available in all modes of _BeoLiving Intelligence_, as it comes from factory and after upgrading to _BeoLiving Intelligence PRO_.

The scope of this document comprises the necessary knowledge and steps to follow to link _BeoLiving Intelligence_ with third party cloud services.

## Linking process

To enable a cloud service with _BeoLiving Intelligence_ a linking process must be done. This linking process is established between _BeoLiving 
Intelligence_ and the third party cloud service, with _Khimo.com_ (our own cloud service) as an intermediary. For each service, this link could be
done on the third party's mobile application or through their websites.

For each third party cloud service, linking process starts as follows:

1. **Enable Alexa skill** 
    - Using the _Alexa App_ or entering _alexa.amazon.com_, head to _Skills_ and search "_BeoLiving Intelligence skill by Khimo_".
    - Press _Enable Skill_ button.

<!--
+ **IFTTT**: using _IFTTT_ App or entering at _ifttt.com_, search by service "_BeoLink Gateway_". Press _Connect_ button.
-->
2. **Link to BLI App**
    - Independently of the chosen cloud service, after enabling the third party app you will be redirected to _Khimo.com_, where a message asking to 
continue the linking process in the _BeoLiving App_ will be displayed if using an _iOS_ device or a QR code will be displayed if not.


**At this point to continue with the linking process you could choose between three methods:**

   - Continue with the _BeoLiving App_ (using an _iOS_ device) and then select which _BeoLiving Intelligence_ (if there is more than one in
your network) to link. Then to finish the linking process it's necessary to go back to the third party's app. 
   - Scan the QR code with the _BeoLiving App_.
   - Login with user and password to _Khimo_ (for _BeoLink Gateway_ users). 

The following video shows how to link _Alexa_ using the first method described:

<div class="row justify-content-center">
  <div class="col-sm-5">     
	<div class="embed-responsive" style="padding-bottom: 179%;">
	  <iframe class="embed-responsive-item" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/W_4cyvD2Q1Q?autoplay=1&loop=1&playlist=W_4cyvD2Q1Q"  frameborder="0" height="570" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen></iframe>
	</div>
  </div>
</div>
<br>

After accomplishing one of these three methods, it's possible to start using the linked cloud service.
