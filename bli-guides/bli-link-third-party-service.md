The scope of this document comprise the necessary knowledge and steps to follow to link _BeoLiving Intelligence_ with third party cloud services.

## Link process

To enable each cloud service with _BeoLiving Intelligence_ a linking process must be done. This linking process is established between _BeoLiving 
Intelligence_ and the third party cloud service, with _Khimo.com_ (our own cloud service) as an intermediary. For each service, this link could be
done through their respective mobile applications or through their websites.

For each third party cloud service, linking process starts as follows:

+ **Alexa**: using _Alexa App_ or entering at _alexa.amazon.com_, go to _Skills_ and search "_BeoLiving Intelligence skill by Khimo_". Press 
_Enable Skill_ button.

<!--
+ **IFTTT**: using _IFTTT_ App or entering at _ifttt.com_, search by service "_BeoLink Gateway_". Press _Connect_ button.
-->

Independetly of the chosen cloud service, after enabling the third party app you will be redirected to _Khimo.com_, where a message asking to 
continue the linking process in the _BeoLiving App_ will be displayed if using an _iOS_ device or QR code will be shown if not.
 
At this point to continue with the linking process you could choose between three methods:

+ Accept to continue with the _BeoLiving App_ (using an _iOS_ device) and then select which _BeoLiving Intelligence_ (if there is more than one in
your network) to link. Then to finalize with the linking process it's necessary to go back to the third party app. 
+ Scan the QR code with the _BeoLiving App_.
+ Login with user and password to _Khimo_ (for _BeoLink Gateway_ users). 

The following video shows how to link _Alexa_ using the first method described:
