## Drivers
Developers wishing to integrate a new system or unsupported device with the BeoLiving intelligence may create a driver for the BLI to communicate with their system. The driver development guide is available for anybody wishing to try and write their own driver in Lua programming language. 

The BeoLiving Intelligence’s web Setup page has a driver development tool (_Tools–>Advanced–>Custom Driver Editor_) that permits you to test your driver while deveoping.

### Driver development
Driver development for a system will enable communication between it and the BLI:

+ [Driver development guide](/bli-guides/developers-guides/driverDevelopmentGuide)

Assistance is available through our support email: _support@khimo.com_

### Available Drivers
A complete list of the supported systems is available on the [Drivers](/help_drivers) page. You will find the documentation of each driver by pressing on the driver's name.


## Clients
Another form of integration with the BeoLiving Intelligence would be to control the BLI (and all resources on it) by creating a client interface to control the BeoLiving Intelligence through another channel (instead of through the App, web or TV).
There is a Home Integration Protocol for this, to gain access you can send an email to _support@khimo.com_ stating interest in the system, etc.

Client creation would enable the user to gain control of everything the BLI controls (this includes B&O products and much more. E.g: DoorBird, Dynalite, Lutron, Nest thermostat, Philips Hue, Vantage, Velux, etc.).
