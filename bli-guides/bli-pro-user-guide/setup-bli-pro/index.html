The setup interface is the most important tool for the configuration/programming of your <i>BLI PRO</i>. The following sections will guide you through the entire web interface configuration tool.  

The <i>BLI PRO</i> has a special user -<i>admin</i>- meant for installer/technician usage. By default, <i>admin's</i> password is unknown due to security purposes. To make use of the Setup interface, password for <i>admin</i> user must be reset by activating the Setup button function number 2 ([See button functions](../../bli_advanced_user_guide/05-user_button)). After a successfull button function input, <i>admin</i> password will be <i>"admin"</i> for the next 5 minutes (also for security purposes) and as soon as you log in you will be asked to change it.
