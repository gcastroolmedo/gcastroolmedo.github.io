### How do I upgrade the _BeoLiving Intelligence_ to PRO mode?
<a id="how-to-upgrade-beoliving-intelligence-to-pro-mode"/>

Being logged as "_admin_" user ([How do I access the setup interface as admin?](#admin-password)), at the top menu bar the **ESSENTIAL** access page contains information regarding your _BLI_ and _Licensing information_.
In _Product information_, the _License type_ shows the current license of your _BLI_, with a link for upgrading to _BLI PRO_. This link will redirect you to *Khimo.com*, where you can start the upgrade process via _PayPal_.

Once the payment process finishes, your _BLI_ will be automatically upgraded to _PRO_ mode within a minute approximately.

### How do I get my _BeoLiving Intelligence_ IP address?

You can find out the IP address of your _BeoLiving Intelligence_ in several ways, some suggestions:

- Use a network scanner/IP-scanner (e.g. the free-ware Fing). The best result is obtained using a hand held device; remember to access the Wi-Fi 
network used by the _BeoLiving Intelligence_.
- Using a computer on the same network as the _BeoLiving Intelligence_ and an application that supports Bonjour discovery (e.g. the Safari browser
, avahi-browse), lookup for "\_hipservices.\_tcp." service.
- Access to your _LAN_ router and search for the assigned IP to _BeoLiving Intelligence_. 

### How do I access the setup interface as admin? {#admin-password}

An installer can access to _BeoLiving Intelligence's_ setup interface with the _admin_ user, which has an unknown password by default. The Setup 
function 2 can be used for setting the _admin_ password to _"admin"_ for 5 minutes, and the _BLI_ will request a password update as soon as the 
web interface is accessed.
