### Can I controll my devices outside my house?

Remote access is available in all firmware versions of _BeoLiving Intelligence_. You can activate it by going to your _BeoLiving Intelligence_ 
settings in the _BLApp_.

### How can I control my _BeoLiving Intelligence_?

_BeoLiving Intelligence_ has multiple ways of user interfaces for control your building. From factory, _BeoLiving Intelligence_ could be 
controlled only by _BeoLiving App_ and _Voice_ (linking your _BeoLiving Intelligence_ with _Alexa_). After upgrade your _BeoLiving Intelligence_ 
mode to _PRO_, control through _BeoLiving Intelligence_ web interface and _Home Control_ native application of Bang & Olufsen TV's becomes 
available.

### If the power goes off, do I lost _BeoLiving Intelligence_ configuration?

_BeoLiving Intelligence_'s configuration is persistent, so all configuration and programmation will be safe if any power-off occurs.

### What kind of devices can I control?

_BeoLiving Intelligence_ supports any _Bang & Olfusen NetworkLink_ TV or speaker device. However if you upgrade it to _BeoLiving Intelligence PRO_ it could support any of the following resources (if the driver for that Home Automation system is available and it supports the product):

* _DIMMER_: Any Light/Dimmer.
* _SHADE_: Any Curtain/Shade/Blinds.
* _THERMOSTAT_: Thermostat of 1 or 2 set points.
* _BUTTON_: Wall buttons or keypads.
* _GPIO_: General purpose input output.
* _AV RENDER_: Any _Bang & Olfusen NetworkLink_ TV or speaker device.
* _ALARM_: Alarm system. 

All of these resources are called "_Standard resources_" and most of them (less the _GPIO_'s) have a graphic representation in each user 
interface. On the other hand, _BeoLiving Intelligence_ also supports "_Custom resources_" that are system dependent and can not be represented as 
a standard resource. Those don't have a graphic respresentation in user interfaces but could be controlled through _Scenes_ programming.

### How can I know which _Home Automation_ systems can be integrated?

As this market never stops growing, we don't stop integrating new _Home Automation_ systems and cloud services. The list of all supported systems 
are showed at [System Drivers Guide](../bli-help-files/drivers/main.md) page. For being updated with the latest news of new supported systems
 and functionalities don't miss our [Newsletter](***LINK***).
