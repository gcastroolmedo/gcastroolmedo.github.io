# Introduction

Using your BeoRemote One, you may gain access to a BeoLiving Intelligence (BLI) through a Bang & Olufsen Smart TV.

> The connection process between a BLI and a B&O TV is detailed in [this tutorial](./bli-connect-to-TV.md). 

You will be able to access the BLI's webpanel to control all your home's equipment (i.e. lights, shades, cameras, etc.) as well as trigger any macros you may have previously set up.

*You will also be able to configure shortcuts to trigger events and Macros by pressing only a couple of buttons.*

Adding your TV as a resource is enough to recive events from the TV. The configuration through the TV is the one that enables access to the HOME CONTROL panel.

# Configure and trigger shortcuts
As with the HOME CONTROL option on your OneRemote's LIST, you can reveal other options on the list: LIGHT and CONTROL.

To access any of these options menus, you have to select the option (e.g. LIGHT) by pressing the right arrow so that the command functions are displayed.

By pressing any of these options (called _Functions_ by the BLI), you are now able to fire events to the BLI that you can use to trigger Macros.

One may also fire events through LIGHT by simply highlighting LIGHT on the OneRemote's LIST and pressing numbers on the keypad which have been previously assigned to trigger macros.

By going to the _Monitor_ tool on the web setup page, it is possible to view exactly the name of the events triggered with the functions.
