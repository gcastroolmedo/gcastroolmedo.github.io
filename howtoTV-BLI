##Introduction
Using your BeoRemote One, you may gain access to a BeoLiving Intelligence (BLI) through a Bang & Olufsen Smart TV.
After completing the connection process detailed in this tutorial, you will be able to control all your home's equipment (i.e. lights, shades, cameras, etc.) as well as trigger any macros you may have previously set up.

## Part 1: Connect your B&O smart TV to a BLI

- With the TV on any source, press MENU to access the main menu.
- Go down to SETUP and open the center button.
- As soon as you access the setup menu, before pressing anything else, keep the red button pressed for 3 seconds and without letting go press the center button.
- Once in the customer service menu, go to SETTINGS and press the center button.
- Go to REROUTE LIGHT/CONTROL and access the menu by pressing the right arrow on your remote.
- This menu shows you B&O systems available (BeoLiving Inteligences, BeoLink Gateways, Music players, etc.). Select your BLI by pressing the center button and once back in the settings menu, press the center circle to save your new settings.
