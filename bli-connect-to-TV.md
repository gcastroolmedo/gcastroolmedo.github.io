# Introduction
The connection between a Bang & Olufsen TV and a BeoLiving Intelligence enables the user to access the Home Control Panel (similar to web interface) on the TV's screen.
It will also enable scene execution with a OneRemote as explained in the [How to control Your BLI with the One Controller](/howto-OneRemote-BLI.html).
